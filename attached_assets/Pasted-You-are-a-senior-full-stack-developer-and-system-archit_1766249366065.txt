You are a senior full-stack developer and system architect.

Build a complete, production-ready full-stack web application called
"StudentPrompt AI – One AI Prompt Assistant for Every Student Need".

🎯 Target users:
College and university students.

🎯 Core goal:
Help students convert simple ideas into optimized AI prompts and generate
high-quality outputs for:
1. Exam preparation & notes
2. Coding & mini projects
3. Career growth (LinkedIn posts, resumes)

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────

1️⃣ Frontend (React)
- Use React with Vite
- Dark theme with modern UI
- Student-friendly, premium look
- Slight 3D / depth feel using animations (Framer Motion)
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

UI Screens:
- Home page with project title: "StudentPrompt AI"
- Mode selection cards:
  • Study Mode
  • Coding Mode
  • Career Mode
- Input text area: "Enter your idea"
- Generate button
- Output section with:
  • Final AI response
  • Copy button
- Loading animation while AI is processing

2️⃣ Backend (Node.js + Express)
- REST API architecture
- One main POST API endpoint: /generate
- Accepts:
  {
    mode: "study" | "coding" | "career",
    userInput: string
  }

- Based on selected mode, generate a different optimized system prompt:
  • Study Mode → exam-ready notes (simple, structured)
  • Coding Mode → clean explanation + working code
  • Career Mode → professional LinkedIn / resume-style content

- Integrate OpenAI API (GPT-4o preferred)
- Secure API key using environment variables
- Proper error handling

3️⃣ AI Prompt Engineering (IMPORTANT)
- Use a system prompt like:
  "You are an expert academic/coding/career assistant for students.
   Convert the user's idea into an optimized prompt and generate the best possible output."

- Ensure:
  • Clear structure
  • Student-friendly language
  • Practical output

4️⃣ API Response
- Return only clean, formatted output
- No unnecessary explanations
- Ready to copy and use

5️⃣ Deployment Readiness
- Frontend deployable on Vercel / Netlify
- Backend deployable on Render / Railway
- Environment variable usage documented
- Production folder structure
